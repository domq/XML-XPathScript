XPathScript is an XML templating language written in and using Perl,
that has some concepts from ASP and some from XSLT. This makes for a
very flexible option for transforming XML to HTML or text or just
about any other format.

An example XPathScript template that turns all XHTML links to italics:

<%
$t->{'a'}{pre} = '<i>';
$t->{'a'}{post} = '</i>';
%>
<%= apply_templates() %>

The full power of XPath is available (via XML::XPath) to locate nodes in
your XML and navigate through your XML tree.

Lots of documentation is available on XPathScript at 
http://axkit.org/wiki/view/AxKit/XPathScriptGuide

XPathScript was originally only available in AxKit, but this version is
independant of AxKit. All the originaly functionality is available,
except for the lack of a $r (Apache::Request) object and axkit:// URIs.

Help is available on the AxKit users mailing list. See http://axkit.org for
more details.
